    <section>
        <p>1. The first thing that caught my attention upon interacting with the experience is the bright colors with unique drawings that appeared the moment I entered the website with classical music that I truly enjoyed.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>2. Within the 2 minutes of interacting with the experience :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I scrolled and was met with amazing designs and graphics</li>
            <li>I was also greeted with classical music that goes great with the atmosphere</li>
            <li>The moment I entered the website and when I moved my cursor across the big “Sculpting Harmony” a bunch of words that formed a sentence started to appear like a trail behind my cursor which I found very fun and interesting.</li>
            <li>I read about how Frank Gehry and his team engaged in an unprecedented traffic between handcraft and digital tooling in developing designs for the Walt Disney Concert Hall.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>3. The part of the experience that I spent the most time with is when I zoom in to interact with the “Museum” because it is very detailed which makes me engaged in interacting with the experience.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>4. My most common action in the 2 minutes interaction is scrolling because it is the main action to be able to interact with the experience.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>5. My first impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience is to catch the visitor’s attention to make them want to explore and interact further with the experience.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>6. The interactive experience communicates its primary goal by displaying text which talks about the Walt Disney Concert Halls that visitors can read and learn at the same time while interacting with the experience.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>7. My impression of how the experience should be interacted over time is not that great because at the start it is pretty unique due to the moving cursor trails but as I interact more it just becomes a scroll and read game which gets boring over time.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>8. The interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time is that the experience explicitly tells the user on how they should interact by saying “Scroll to continue”.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>9. The other media forms that the experience reference is music, videos further explaining the concept of the experience and arts so further make the user more immersed in the experience.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>10. These references communicate to me about how I should act when engaging with my research experience by showing that including alot of other media forms is a good way to keep visitors to interact with the experience.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>11. The references communicated to me about how I should feel when engaging with my research experience by putting myself in the visitors' shoes and pretending that I am visiting and interacting with another experience to know what more I should do or remove to keep the experience fun and not boring.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>12. The most frustrating part of the interaction to me is when I have to spend alot of time scrolling to read because after a while it gets irritating and boring with the interactive experience.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>13. The most satisfying part of the interaction to me is when I move the cursor and a trail of words appear behind my cursor. It is satisfying because I had fun moving it around and making shapes and the words would follow it which makes the interaction with the experience very joyful.</p>
